The problem is I can say exactly why this failed. All the coeffs are almost right, there is simply one missing, and this was almost certainly because it was correctly found but was then too small to pass thresholding. I investigated this in advance and it should have been above threshold, but with the L1 perurbation, it might have slipped below. I would bet that decreasing the L1 to 10**-6 would rescue this problem.
